Online Novels to PDF

Use this to scrape a website of a series of indexed webpages and convert the content to a PDF.

This requires: Python 3, Mechanicalsoup, Pypdf

If you are running Ubuntu run sudo ./debian-setup.sh in this directory. this will install pip and python modules. To make sure you have python3, run: python3 --version

You will be asked information on the data you want to scrape. All you need to know is the address of the first page, what number in the address brings you to the next page, and a keyword in the page titles that is unique to only the pages you want to scrape.

If you know the element in which the content is stored on the page, you can feed this in. The element type is the tag name: div, p, span, etc. The unique attribute name and value is not required, but it is highly recommended if the website you're scraping has many elements before the actual content. the attribute name may be an id or class, and the value could be chapter-content or text. 

Example program run:

Title of PDF: my-book
Address of first page: http://example.com/books/bestbookever/pg1736.html
Incrementing index: 1736
Keyword in Title (To make sure only scraping what is needed): Best Book Ever!
